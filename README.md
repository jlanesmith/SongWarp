# SongWarp
Welcome to [SongWarp](https://songwarp.onrender.com/)! This app consists of two programs which can be used to give you greater insight into your musical taste and how it changes over time!

## Development
To run SongWarp on your local machine, run the following commands:

`yarn build`

`yarn start`

## Hosting platform

Initially, SongWarp was hosted by [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), but due to changes in the pricing models, I switched it to [Render](https://render.com/). If switching website hosting platforms again in the future, don't forget to enter the environment variables into the platform's dashboard!
